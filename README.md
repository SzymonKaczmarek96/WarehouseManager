# Warehouse Management System

## Project Overview

The **Warehouse Management System** (WMS) is an ongoing project aimed at streamlining warehouse operations by automating product reception and release processes. This system provides RESTful APIs to manage inventory and track product movements in and out of the warehouse. Additionally, it generates a daily PDF report summarizing all transactions, with automation scheduled to ensure operational efficiency.

The system is being developed collaboratively by two team members, each working on separate Git branches. Code reviews are conducted regularly, and merge conflicts are resolved through collaboration to ensure a smooth development process.

## Key Features

- **RESTful APIs** for managing warehouse operations
- **Automated product reception and release**
- **Inventory management** for tracking stock levels and product movement
- **Daily PDF reports** summarizing warehouse transactions
- **Scheduled automation** for routine tasks like report generation and data processing

## Technologies Used

- **Java 21+**: The backend programming language, providing modern features and performance.
- **Spring Boot 3+**: Framework used to build scalable and efficient microservices.
- **Hibernate**: ORM for interacting with the database and managing inventory data.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework for ensuring the reliability of the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability of the application.
- **Mockito**: Framework for unit testing with mock data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: For secure authentication and authorization in the API.
- **Kafka**: Used for event-driven architecture to handle communication between services.
- **Quartz Scheduler**: For scheduling tasks such as automated report generation and other maintenance jobs.
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD**: For automating build, test, and deployment workflows.

## Current Status

This project is still in progress. New features are being developed, and improvements are continuously being made. Please stay tuned for updates as the project evolves!
